description: Writes a spec before any code — the first phase of spec-driven development. Use when starting a new project, feature, or significant change and no specification exists yet. Use when requirements are unclear, ambiguous, or only exist as a vague idea.

# Specify

## Overview

Write a structured specification before writing any code. The spec is the shared source of truth between you and the human engineer — it defines what we're building, why, and how we'll know it's done. Code without a spec is guessing.

This is the **SPECIFY** phase, the first of the four-phase spec-driven-development pipeline (`SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → RECONCILE`). The full phase map and gates live in the `spec-driven-development` skill; where artifacts live is resolved by the SDD instruction. This skill produces one artifact — `spec.md` — and then hands off to the PLAN phase in a fresh context.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project or feature
- Requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- The change touches multiple files or modules
- You're about to make an architectural decision
- The task would take more than 30 minutes to implement

**When NOT to use:** Single-line fixes, typo corrections, or changes where requirements are unambiguous and self-contained.

## Surface Assumptions First

Start with a high-level vision. Ask the human clarifying questions until requirements are concrete.

**Before writing any spec content, list what you're assuming:**

```
ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:
1. This is a web application (not native mobile)
2. Authentication uses session-based cookies (not JWT)
3. The database is PostgreSQL (based on existing Prisma schema)
4. We're targeting modern browsers only (no IE11)
→ Correct me now or I'll proceed with these.
```

Don't silently fill in ambiguous requirements. The spec's entire purpose is to surface misunderstandings *before* code gets written — assumptions are the most dangerous form of misunderstanding.

## The Six Core Areas

A spec covers these six areas:

1. **Objective** — What are we building and why? Who is the user? What does success look like?

2. **Commands** — Full executable commands with flags, not just tool names.
   ```
   Build: npm run build
   Test: npm test -- --coverage
   Lint: npm run lint --fix
   Dev: npm run dev
   ```

3. **Project Structure** — Where source code lives, where tests go, where docs belong.
   ```
   src/           → Application source code
   src/components → React components
   src/lib        → Shared utilities
   tests/         → Unit and integration tests
   e2e/           → End-to-end tests
   docs/          → Documentation
   ```

4. **Code Style** — One real code snippet showing your style beats three paragraphs describing it. Include naming conventions, formatting rules, and examples of good output.

5. **Testing Strategy** — What framework, where tests live, coverage expectations, which test levels for which concerns.

6. **Boundaries** — Three-tier system:
   - **Always do:** Run tests before commits, follow naming conventions, validate inputs
   - **Ask first:** Database schema changes, adding dependencies, changing CI config
   - **Never do:** Commit secrets, edit vendor directories, remove failing tests without approval

## Spec Template

```markdown
# Spec: [Project/Feature Name]

## Objective
[What we're building and why. User stories or acceptance criteria.]

## Tech Stack
[Framework, language, key dependencies with versions]

## Commands
[Build, test, lint, dev — full commands]

## Project Structure
[Directory layout with descriptions]

## Code Style
[Example snippet + key conventions]

## Testing Strategy
[Framework, test locations, coverage requirements, test levels]

## Boundaries
- Always: [...]
- Ask first: [...]
- Never: [...]

## Success Criteria
[How we'll know this is done — specific, testable conditions]

## Open Questions
[Anything unresolved that needs human input]
```

## Reframe Instructions as Success Criteria

When receiving vague requirements, translate them into concrete conditions:

```
REQUIREMENT: "Make the dashboard faster"

REFRAMED SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Dashboard LCP < 2.5s on 4G connection
- Initial data load completes in < 500ms
- No layout shift during load (CLS < 0.1)
→ Are these the right targets?
```

This lets you loop, retry, and problem-solve toward a clear goal rather than guessing what "faster" means.

## Hand Off to PLAN

When the spec is written and the human has reviewed it, the SPECIFY phase is done. Save the spec, then **stop and let the next phase start in a fresh context** — a `/clear` or a new session — rather than rolling straight into planning. Nothing clears context mid-session on its own, so the reset is a manual step you take at this review gate.

- Save the spec to `docs/specs/<capability>/spec.md`, resolving the base location per the SDD instruction (declared → detectable → default `docs/`).
- The PLAN phase (`planning-and-task-breakdown`) reads this `spec.md` back from disk. It does not need this session's conversation — the spec is the entire handoff. Starting PLAN fresh keeps its context focused on turning the spec into tasks.

## Keeping the Spec Alive

The spec is a living document, not a one-time artifact:

- **Update when decisions change** — If you discover the data model needs to change, update the spec first, then implement.
- **Update when scope changes** — Features added or cut should be reflected in the spec.
- **Commit the spec** — The spec belongs in version control alongside the code.
- **Reference the spec in PRs** — Link back to the spec section that each PR implements.

Mid-flight edits happen in place here. The final fold-back — reconciling everything that diverged during implementation — is the RECONCILE phase (`spec-reconciliation`), not this skill.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is simple, I don't need a spec" | Simple tasks don't need *long* specs, but they still need acceptance criteria. A two-line spec is fine. |
| "I'll write the spec after I code it" | That's documentation, not specification. The spec's value is in forcing clarity *before* code. |
| "The spec will slow us down" | A 15-minute spec prevents hours of rework. Waterfall in 15 minutes beats debugging in 15 hours. |
| "Requirements will change anyway" | That's why the spec is a living document. An outdated spec is still better than no spec. |
| "The user knows what they want" | Even clear requests have implicit assumptions. The spec surfaces those assumptions. |

## Red Flags

- Starting to write code without any written requirements
- Asking "should I just start building?" before clarifying what "done" means
- Implementing features not mentioned in any spec or task list
- Making architectural decisions without documenting them
- Skipping the spec because "it's obvious what to build"
- Rolling from SPECIFY straight into PLAN or IMPLEMENT in the same context instead of writing the spec and starting the next phase fresh

## Verification

Before handing off to PLAN, confirm:

- [ ] The spec covers all six core areas
- [ ] The human has reviewed and approved the spec
- [ ] Success criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Boundaries (Always/Ask First/Never) are defined
- [ ] The spec is saved to a file in the repository
